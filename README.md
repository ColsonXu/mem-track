# mem-track
A program I use to track the amount of memory space left during memory-intensive operations. For example, during compilations. The result can help me optimize the compilation process to use the maximum number of threads without crashing.

## TO-DO
- [ ] Gragh out the memory usage.
- [ ] Add user arguments and a help page.
- [ ] Fix formatting to include units after numbers.
